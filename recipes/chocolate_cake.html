    <h1>Chocolate Cake</h1>
    <p>This is a typical French homemade cake — dense, dark, and delicious. It is a European sponge cake, with a different texture than its American counterparts.</p>
    <p>It is excellent when dusted with confectioners' sugar and served with lightly sweetened whipped cream or a fruit coulis.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White sugar: 100g</li>
        <li>Semi-sweet chocolate: 285g</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter: 170g</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract: 10ml</li>
        <li>Salt: to taste</li>
        <li>Eggs, separated: 5 large</li>
        <li>Sifted all-purpose flour: 30g</li>
        <li>Cream of tartar: 1 pinch ~0.5g</li>
        <li>Confectioners' sugar for dusting: 7g</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven at 165ºC.</li>
        <li>Set aside <strong>38g of suga</strong>r. Place <strong>chocolate</strong>, <strong>butter</strong>, and <strong>remaining sugar</strong> in a large, heavy-based pan. Cook over moderate heat until chocolate and butter have melted, and sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from heat. Stir in <strong>vanilla</strong>, and leave mixture to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Beat <strong>egg yolks</strong> into chocolate mixture one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in <strong>flour</strong>.</li>
        <li>In a scrupulously clean, grease-free, and large bowl, beat <strong>egg whites</strong> until foamy. Add <strong>cream of tartar</strong> and <strong>salt</strong>, and beat to stiff peaks. Sprinkle <strong>reserved sugar</strong> over egg whites, and beat until stiff and glossy. Use a whisk or spatula to fold 1/3 of egg whites into chocolate mixture, then carefully fold in remaining whites. Carefully pour batter into the prepared tin, and tap the tin gently to release air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Bake until well risen and a skewer inserted into center of the cake comes out clean, for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li> 
        <li>Check cake after 30 minutes; if cake appears to rise unevenly, rotate after 30 to 35 minutes. If cake starts to crack or become too brown, place a piece of foil lightly over top.</li>
        <li>Transfer cake to a wire cooling rack, and remove the sides of the springform tin. Cool completely, and then remove the base. <em>Do not attempt to remove cake before it's completely cooled as this cake is very fragile.</em></li>

    </ol>
